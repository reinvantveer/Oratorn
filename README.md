# Oratorn
A space invaders-like remake in Pygame

# It:
- [x] Has a really good background image
- [x] Drops an image object somewhere randomly at the top of the screen
- [x] One alien comes down
- [x] Pressing 'up' will increase the speed
- [x] Pressing 'down' will decrease the speed
- [x] Having the alien touch the bottom ends the game
- [x] A new ship appears now and then
- [ ] If the exercise is difficult, the ship moves down slower
